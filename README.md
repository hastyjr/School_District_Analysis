# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is correct evidence of academic dishonesty discovered by the school board. The targeted data analyzed is specifically around math and reading for all 9th graders at `Thomas High School`, as it appears those grades have been altered. The objective in the below analysis is to replace the 9th grade reading and math scores, then repeat the district analysis to show a true measure of passing grades through out the district. 

## Results

* **How is the district summary affected?**

    The district summary of student data was affected as one of the schools had grades altered for their ninth grade class. The data was altered in a way that skewed the overall data for all schools in the district. You will see the difference between the overall passing scores in comparison to each other is a difference of `0.316608%`

    **Replacing the 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School with NaN**
    
    Before we were able to get to this difference in percentage, we had to select all reading and math scores from Thomas High School and replace those scores with `NaN` so that they would not factore into the new percentage.
